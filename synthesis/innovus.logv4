[03/09 04:11:22     34s] CTS treats D-pins and I/O pins as non-synchronous pins by default.
[03/09 04:11:22     34s] If you want to change the behavior, you need to use the SetDPinAsSync
[03/09 04:11:22     34s] or SetIoPinAsSync statement in the clock tree specification file,
[03/09 04:11:22     34s] or use the setCTSMode -traceDPinAsLeaf {true|false} command,
[03/09 04:11:22     34s] or use the setCTSMode -traceIoPinAsLeaf {true|false} command
[03/09 04:11:22     34s] before specifyClockTree command.
